# Smart-Cooling-System-for-a-Machinery-Room

The aim of this project is to design a cooling system which is automatically controlled
according to the temperature of a particular room. This system is useful, especially in the
cooling of machinery which generates a lot of heat during operation. This heat can be
caused to damage the machinery and reduce its lifetime.
The system uses temperature sensors to measure the temperature of the machinery, and
the microcontroller could control the speed of the cooling fans based on the temperature
data received. It also includes an alert system to notify if the temperature exceeds safe
limits.
